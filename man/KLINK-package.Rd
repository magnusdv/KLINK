\title{KLINK: Kinship Analysis with Linked Markers}
\description{
A 'shiny' application for forensic kinship testing, based on the 'pedsuite' R packages. 'KLINK' is closely aligned with the (non-R) software 'Familias' and 'FamLink', but offers several unique features, including visualisations and automated report generation. The calculation of likelihood ratios supports pairs of linked markers, and all common mutation models.
