## Running KLINK locally

If you are working with sensitive data, you might want to run KLINK locally/offline. To set this up, first install the KLINK package in R:

```{r eval = F}
install.packages("KLINK")
```

Then you may start KLINK as follows:
```{r, eval = F}
KLINK::runKLINK()
```

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/screenshot-klink.png")
```
