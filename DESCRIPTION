Description: A Shiny app based on the 'pedsuite' packages, for computing
    likelihood ratios in forensic kinship testing. The app is similar in
    purpose to the (non-R) software 'Familias' and 'FamLink', but offers a
    number of unique features, including visualisations and automated
    report generation. Pairs of linked markers are supported, as well as
    all common mutation models.
